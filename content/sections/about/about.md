Hi, I'm David Chen, a graduate student from UIUC with a focus on AI and ML. I am currently working at Rivian as a Machine Learning Intern (was the Camera Imaging Intern before the current role). 

​

My personal projects covers an _**[AI E-Llearning Platform](https://www.promptseed.ai)**_, optimization of control-based autonomous vehicle routing, and IEEE recognized research paper in semantic segmentation.



Beyond that, I channel my passion for AI as a content creator. Our team's _**[newsletter](https://theaiespresso.substack.com/)**_ garners thousands of views, boasting an open rate that doubles the industry average.

​
> At this moment, I am actively looking for new grad opportunities. Please feel free to reach out at _**teweiwc2@illinois.edu**_. Thanks.
